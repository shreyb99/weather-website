# Weather Website
Weather website is the simple web app made with instructions from Andrew Mead from the Udemy Course 'The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)'.
It provides weather forecasts of the location entered using its geolocation (latitude and longitude), which includes whole address of location, current as well as minimum and maximum temperatures of the day and chances of precipitation.

Creation of this website was made using - 
1) Express, which is used for creating web servers and serving HTML and JSON and static assets like HTML, CSS, Js, images and text.
2) Handlebars, main templating engine learnt for rendering dynamic HTML content.

This is deployed on Heroku.
